This is package yp17, made by HCSSiM, 2009 for use of HCSSiM students, alumni, and staff (and anyone else who wants to, for that matter).

To install, move the file yp17.sty along with contradiction.pdf, logo.pdf, and yp4.pdf to a directory searched by TeX.  If yp17.sty does not exist, run yp17.ins through LaTeX to create it.

For documentation, open yp17.pdf.  If this does not exist, run LaTeX on yp17.dtx.
